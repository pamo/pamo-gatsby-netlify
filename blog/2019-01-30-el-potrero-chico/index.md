The little corral.

I learned about this place April 2017 when I was walking up to the summit of Angel's Landing with a group of Spanish-speaking people walking behind me. Curiosity got a hold of me and I turned around to ask where they were from. "De Mexico," they replied. My eyes lit up and I started to make conversation with the group about their plans in the states. I also mentioned that my family is from Mexico, but that I was 10 years old the last time I had visited. My family has majorly moved to North Carolina and my grandparents passed away since then. There hasn't been too much motivation for me to revisit.

Whenever I make the effort to push myself out of my comfort zone to speak to a stranger, I like to ask for their recommendations about an area. I took this opportunity to pose this question to the group: If I wanted to visit Mexico and see something like **this** (as I spread my arms to encompass Zion's main valley) or do some hiking or maybe climbing, where should I go?

There was no hesitation in their response. If I wanted to go climbing, I should definitely go to _El Potrero Chico_ because of its fame among climbers, reputation for one of [Alex Honnold's successful free solos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Phl82D57P58), and all around beauty.

I immediately added it to my bucket list trello board when I got back home from my Zion adventure.

Since then I've floated the idea of climbing in Mexico to several friends but never really acted on getting the ball rolling. We've been outdoors several times in California since then. March 2018 was the first time we visited Bishop, CA, for the Women's Climbing Festival and were enamored with the beauty of the land as well as approachability of the climbing. We returned again for #Climbsgiving in November 2018 to give some outdoor leading a go in Owens River Gorge, as well as paying a visit to Alabama Hills.

It's always a joy to get out of the city and share incredible experiences with friends outdoors.

This new year had me feeling like I was missing out on something but I couldn't figure out _what_. I started to replay the things I had done in the last year and remembered this being the time when I started getting a travel bug. I said yes to the first thing that anyone mentioned to me and found myself in Banff in the thick of Canadian winter. If you know me, you know I absolutely despise being cold, but the travel bug knows no discomfort.

The travel bug started me getting back to researching trips to El Potrero Chico. I floated the idea around and there seemed to be interest but no real drive to commit. It felt too soon to try to plan anything in the next month or two, but there were already too many other commitments in the rest of the year (weddings, music festivals, concerts, conferences, etc).

I almost let the plan fall through but I kept the flight itinerary opened in a tab and information about climbing guides in another. I started _talking_ about the idea of going to Mexico to several people. My engineering manager, friends, friends of friends. There was a little voice in the back of my head that kept saying, just book the flight.

The day [this article about millenial burnout](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work) began to become viral on Twitter, I started to read it and got to the graphic of a rope on the brink of breaking when I thought, _just freaking buy the flight_. I stopped reading the article because I couldn't identify with it as a person of color, but the thought of feeling burned out alone drove me to realize I needed to get away by myself.
