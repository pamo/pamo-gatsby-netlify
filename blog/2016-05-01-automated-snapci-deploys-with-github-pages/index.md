title: Automated SnapCI Deploys with Github Pages
---

I'm currently contributing to [Fun Retrospectives](http://funretro.github.io/distributed/) on the ["Front-End Ops"](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/front-end-ops/) front.

One thing that was bugging me before was that we were committing our `dist/` directory or _build_ artifacts on both the `master` and `gh-pages` branch.
New contributors were not sure if these things needed to be [ignored or part of their commits](https://github.com/funretro/distributed/pull/84#issue-149864065).

I don't use any 3rd party hosting service to deploy this blog. It's all [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Github pages are helpful if what you're trying to serve is static.
In the case of my blog, I use [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) to process markdown into HTML. Static site generators are all the rage, and I went with Gatsby because of React (#HipsterJS).

One thing I spent some time on when I set it up was keeping my deployment clean by separating my source code from my static files.
For Github personal pages the static files are always served from the `master` branch and project pages are served from `gh-pages`.

With a tool like [gh-pages](https://npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) it's simple to target what should be served statically (and coincidentally gitignored).

Deployment from a local machine is easy as well. Your Github account should already have SSH Keys configured and deploys (or pushes) are a breeze.

However, when you want a suite of testing and linting to happen beforehand on a CI pipeline, there's some additional configuration that needs to happen.

Oops. Access denied on the [Fun Retrospectives Build](https://snap-ci.com/funretro/distributed/branch/master). I did some Googling and Snap's [Deploying documentation](https://docs.snap-ci.com/getting-started/deploy-with-snap/) looked a little slim for my case.
I found something similar on how to [publish to gh-pages with TravisCI](https://medium.com/@nthgergo/publishing-gh-pages-with-travis-ci-53a8270e87db#.o46hdptyz) but the number of steps made me feel I might want to [open an issue for another day](https://github.com/funretro/distributed/issues/92).

I continued digging anyway.
Snap's page on adding [SSH Keys to a step](https://docs.snap-ci.com/getting-started/ssh-keys/) got me going in the right direction and
the Deploy Keys pane and [documentation](https://developer.github.com/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) on Github seemed to indicate that this would be a... snap.

It was.
I chose to [generate a new key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) and save it to a temporary location on my machine.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "team@funretro.io"
```

```
Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): /Users/pamo/Downloads/key
```

I copied the contents of the generated `key.pub` to the Deploys Key pane on our
funretros repository settings and the contents of the generated key (private file) to the deploy step in our build.

```

Success!

If you're curious to see how I used gh-pages to deploy to specific branches and repositories, have a look at the [deploy script for Fun Retrospectives](https://github.com/funretro/distributed/blob/master/deploy.sh) and the [one for this blog](https://github.com/pamo/pamo.github.io/blob/development/package.json#L10).

```
#!/bin/sh
LAST_COMMIT=$(git log -1 --pretty=format:'%h %an %s')
echo "Deploying changes from $LAST_COMMIT"
gh-pages -r git@github.com:funretro/distributed.git -d dist -m "Updates from $LAST_COMMIT"
```
