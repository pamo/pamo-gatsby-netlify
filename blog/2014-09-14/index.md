I'm attending the my first [Strange Loop](https://thestrangeloop.com/schedule) conference this year in St. Louis, MO. The opportunity is kind of a big deal and I owe it all to
the conference organizers and sponsors for allowing me to attend as a [diversity scholar](https://thestrangeloop.com/attendees/diversity-scholarships).

I've taken a few glances at the conference schedule and it's been hard to decide which topics I want to check out. When I go to conferences, I always have an internal debate on whether I should go to a talk I know nothing about and may not understand or stick to topics I am familiar with and may learn more about.
There are definitely more unfamiliar topics on the schedule this time around, so the next few days will be full of surprises.

[Stephen Wolfram's](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/inside-the-wolfram-language) talk is definitely one I won't miss. [DOMStep](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/domstep-audio-synthesis-ai-and-a-javascript-dance-party)? If it involves WUBWUBWUB, wobblin', and waiting for beats to drop, I'm there.
Recommendations have also helped me in choosing on Pete Hunt's talk on [React](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/react-restful-ui-rendering) and Yodit Stanton's [IoT in Practice](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/the-internet-of-things-in-practice).

In addition, I'm attending the [Powered by Javascript](https://thestrangeloop.com/preconf-page/powered-by-javascript) workshop the Wednesday before Strange Loop begins. I've been working
with AngularJS, grunt, gulp, and Sass at work for the last 6 or so months topics with those keywords caught my eye on the [lineup](http://www.manning.com/poweredbyjavascript/).

- Joel Kemp - Using Grunt to auto-generate your Gruntfiles
- Lukas Ruebbelke - AngularJS Application Architecture That Won't Make You Cry
- Mike Mikowski - Dump Less and SASS: Dynamic CSS Manipulation with JavaScript
- Josh Powell - Unraveling the Knot - Clean & Testable Client Side Code
- Ben Vinegar - Next-Gen Tools for Securing your Front-end Code

The next week will be a whirlwind of knowledge and I hope I can capture, digest, and blog about it all in addition to meeting and catching up with friends.
To note: I'll be sharing my hotel room with another ThoughtWorker also named Pamela from one of our Brazilian offices that I've never met before! I'm also excited to see my neighbor, [Tomomi Imura](https://twitter.com/girlie_mac), on the Powered by Javascript schedule. I'm even throwing in a [little bowling with Lambda Ladies](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/lambda-ladies-go-bowling-sponsored-by-fastly-tickets-12789332237).

Are you attending Strange Loop? Tweet at me and let's go to some talks together. :grin:
