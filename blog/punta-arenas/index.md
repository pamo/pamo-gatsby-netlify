## Way of Life

- Length of Stay: One night, August 2016

- Season: Peak of Winter. The night we arrived was the last night of the [Carnaval del Invierno]().

- Reason: Night after Torres del Paine trip

### Local Transportation

Rented a car at PUQ to head to [Puerto Natales](/travel/cl/puerto-natales/) and back. You will have to pay for street parking during the week in cash.

### Money

No issues paying with credit card here.

### Accommodation

Booked a night at [Hotel Chalet Chapital]() on Booking.com for 3 at \$63 USD. Staff was very friendly and
the room was just what we needed after two days of hiking.

### Internet & Mobile

Cell service is available and WiFi can be found at most restaurants and cafés.

## Food

- Had the roast lamb at [Los Ganadores]() for dinner. The meat came in three parts/courses.
  Different and tasty experience. Big wine selection.
- [Café Tapiz]() is no specialty coffee shop, but we stopped in for something warm and ordered a pita sandwich that was big enough for three people to eat!
- [Café Tostato]() makes espresso drinks the right way. I'd recommend a stop in for a cappuccino.
- [La Casa de Doña Maria]() was a last minute lunch pick that was open at the time before we headed off to the airport. Home-style Chilean cooking at reasonable prices.

## Activities

- [Costanera de Punta Arenas]() is a nice stroll along the coast. There are several exercise stations where you can goof off on monkey bars along the way.
- Once you walk along the Costanera long enough, you'll reach [Cervecería Hernando de Magallanes]().
  The brewery itself is tiny and there are no tastings or tours, but the staff was very informative and you can buy a few bottles of beer to take home on your flight.
- [Museo de Magallanes]() can be visited in less than an hour and free. The information covers a lot of the colonization of Chile and South America. The plaques on each exhibit are in Spanish.
