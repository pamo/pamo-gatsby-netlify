title: Notes from Chrome Dev Summit Day 2
---

Notes from Day 2 of Google's Chrome Dev Summit in November of 2016.
My goal is to annotate points with interesting links to topics I would like to explore later on.
Each primary heading is dedicated to one of the talks on the agenda.

# How they Built It

## Housing.com

- Challenged by low-end phones and cellular connectivity.
- Monolithic desktop and mobile implementation.
- Performance was impacted heavily.

### Mobile Mission: Better Discovery

- Mobile web makes it easier for this.
- Mobile web was cheaper! 5 rupees vs a lot more for native.
- Browser support as a first step.

Built [Housing Go](https://tinyurl.com/housingPWA) and had many Feats

- 30% faster page load
- 10% longer sessions
- 40% lower bounce rate
- 38% conversion increase.

:key: **Key Metrics**

- Time to deliver assets
- Reduced HTML to 15kb!
- Preload Critical JS
- Time to first paint
- Experimented with server side rendering. Measure first before implementation.
- App shell
- First load saw a white screen of death to meaningful content
- Loading screen of purgatory 2.2s to 7s
- Improvement s
- Time to first enabled JS interaction
- Server-side rendering allows for this

### Lazy Loading and Lessen the Amount of JS Code

- Code splitting with Webpack 2
- JS and CSS sharding
- Intent based chunking: when a user performs a specific interaction without route change.
- e.g. A notify view is only loaded when the user clicks on the notify button. No need to load this if the user never makes the interaction.

### PRPL -- "Purple"

- Push notifications
- Render server-side
- Pre-cache assets with service workers
- Lazy Load resources on demand

### Experimenting

- Migrating from React to preact + preact-concat
- PWA + AMP

## Lyft.com

### Why?

- Greater reach to old devices
- 8% iOS and 3% Android will be unsupported on older OSes
- No support for Windows or Amazon Fire
- Less resources necessary to support so many devices
- Reduction friction by not requiring a download
- Highly inefficient process that can lose 20% of users
- They don't have enough storage or don't like the permissions necessary
- deep-linking with other apps (like google maps) is more seamless since there's no need to download an app.
- Faster uploads and experimentation
- Hours not weeks to approve a PWA vs app for production

## Timeline

- 4x less engineers vs native to get up and running in just a month

## Features

- Seamless Web Payments
- Auto sign-in
- Service worker takes care of notifications
- Offline feedback submission with Background Sync

### Javascript Diet

- Remove unused code with tree shaking (40% reduction)
  - Angular specific minification with TypeScript and Closure Compiler.
  - 4kb gzipped!
  - Technologies and techniques: State driven routing, lodash, TypeScript, a little bit of React, etc.

### Downsides

- StackOverflow answers are lacking
- limitations with iOS Safari ¯\ _(ツ)_/¯

### Learnings

- Using CSS Animation for opacity infinitely will crash the browser!

# From PWA to AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)

- Bounce rate is killer. 3 seconds is a long time but it's also a very short time.
- Load performance budget is actually <1 second with RTT handshakes, etc.
- Overall landscape is grim. Average mobile page takes 19 seconds and 77% of sites take 10+ to load. Most pages have over 200 HTTP requests (mostly ad related).

## Web Component Library for Highly Portable Content

- AMP HTML
- Sped up by caching
- Faster loading across platforms
- Common use case is content management system.

## AMP Cache

- Super fast CDN-like
- Cheaper to pre-render because position of each element is known.
- No 3rd party JS is loaded.
- One less privacy issue.
- Open source library.
- Sandboxed amp-iframes can include anything (?)

## AMP or PWA?

The constraints of the AMP Cache are

- No user-authored JS
- No custom Service Worker
- No push notifications
- etc.
  AMP is
- Instant delivery
- Optimized discovery
- No user scripts
- Static content
  PWA is
- Advanced Platform Features
- Highly Dynamic
- Slower first delivery
- Not easily embedded

## AMP as a PWA

- [AMPByExample.com](http://ampbyexample.com/) -- showcase AMP components.
- First load is AMP, next interaction on the origin prompts to install Service Worker

# Production PWAs with Frameworks

Addy Osmani, Developer Programs Engineer

> Frameworks can be fast if we put the work in.

But what does it mean to be fast?

## Code Splitting

- Defer the work that's not needed until the future.

## :eyeglasses: :key: Perceived Key Moments in Modern Loading

- IS it happening?
- IS it useful?
- IS it usable?

## How is the React community shipping out code?

- JS Module Bundle? 83% using Webpack.
- Code splitting? 58% thought they _were_, but not really.

## Advice

- Try out Lighthouse over remote debugging to get a real-world perspective.
- Don't keep the main thread busy.
- Code Splitting with Webpack can be done in many ways
  - require.ensure
    - [Docs for Webpack 1](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html)
  - bundle-loader (auto wraps your code in a require.ensure)
- [Use the React router](http://moduscreate.com/code-splitting-for-react-router-with-es6-imports/)
- [PRPL Pattern](https://bit.ly/prpl-pattern) for structuring and serving PWAs
- [HTTP/2 with the Aggressive Splitting Plugin](https://bit.ly/webpack-http2)
  - Gets more granular with the chunks you're serving to your users.
    > Ask what's in your bundle and question if you need all of those dependencies
- [Webpack Performance Budgets/Insights RFC](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/3216) on github to help identify
  - large chunks
  - large entries
  - patterns that notice areas of improvement
- Try [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) for React on a Diet
- [source-map-auditing](https://bit.ly/source-map-explorer)
- [sw-precache with Webpack](https://bit.ly/webpack-precache)
- There are some gotchas with code splitting and Webpack around CORS.

  > Support all target users using progressive enhancement.

## Universal JS has issues

- Makes it easy to get stuck in uncanny valley (empty app shell)

  - `renderToString` is not as fast as we think.
  - Some plugins to consider: `react-dom-stream` `react-ssr-optimization`

  Take a look at [Progressive Web Apps with React series](https://bit.ly/pwa-react)

# Client Storage for Performance

Dru Knox, Product Manager, Chrome

> Client storage is a low-hanging fruit for performance improvements, not just offline functionality

- Deck is stacked against web development when it comes to [network costs](https://bit.ly/network-costs)

## Cache as a performance Optimization

There are different levels of caching.

**Browser cache**

- Unpredictable only works for network responses
- Not granular

**Optimized browser cache**

- Proactive page improvements
- Repeat visits, but still only for network responses
- Still relying on the browser storing things

**Content caching**

- The point at which better control and value is reached.
- Proactive page load improvements but for all response types.
- Image blobs in cache storage.
- Can control and predict content but still relying on the network.
- Can be granular for content but not for network requests.
- Full cache control.

**Proactive (so good it gives Dru :joy:)**

- Fully predictable
  - Guarantee a performance increase to your users
- All response types
- More granularity for BOTH network and content responses

> Content caching is the sweet spot within reach for most developers today.

### Best practices

Client-side Chunking

- Pull in an initial bundle and kick off requests for smaller pieces.
  - Saves network bandwidth overall
- Preload pages user might visit
- Save commonly repeated components (hero images, etc).

### Technologies to use in the browser

- **Cache Storage** for URL Addressable content
  - Utilities: `sw-toolbox`, `sw-prechace`, offline Webpack plugin
- **indexdb** for simple structured data
  - Utilities: localForage (with promises), idb, PouchDB..

Keep in mind overall storage footprint. Browsers are limited in capabilities.

- Chrome 6% of free space per origin
- Firefox 10% of free space
- safari at least 10% of free space
- Edge is more complicated but based on other factors.

> Minimum budget available for performance improvements across all devices and browsers is 50MB

**It can mean 16 seconds of load time saved across averaged visits!**

### Browser Eviction

- In Chrome and Firefox, when disk is full, LRU (least-recently-used)
  domain in the cache is removed
- Safari never clears it.

### Looking Forward

**In Development**

- [Async cookies](https://bit.ly/async-cookies)

**Areas to explore**

# V8 Engine :blue_car:

Seth Thompson, Product Manager, Web Platform
How to measure improvements or performance on loads?

- [Microbenchmarks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/microbenchmark) on language features (like pushing elements to an array in a loop)
- Static Test Suites: Sophisticated benchmarks Game Boy emulator, Raytracer, but not a real picture of all websites. (Octane test suite)
- Real webpages: Instrumentation to analyze _where_ time is being spent to load websites.

> Improvement in V8 has led to a median of 5% performance improvement on the top 25 sites on the web.

## Memory Consumption

Focused on reducing the memory load and found Chrome's overall consumption dropped by 35%.

# Future App Model: Advanced Service Workers

Jake Archibald
[Service Worker Specification](https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker)

## Browser Support

- Considering: Safari
- Implementing: IE
- Shipped: Opera, Chrome, Firefox

## Streams

- Will be able to use Transform [Streams](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#ts-model) to handle text or images in a more powerful way.
- Ideally we would want to serve a single HTTP response and combine streams with service workers and caching to dynamically serve files.
  - Kinda complicated to deal with this in code and processing.

## Foreign Fetching

- Service workers can use Foreign Fetching to fetch fonts with their own service.
- [Cross-origin Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/09/foreign-fetch)
- **Create REST-like APIs that work offline.**

## Background Fetch

- Vague how this works right now.
- Use case would be like downloading a movie or uploading photos. Notification would be sent once it completes.
- Easily cancel-able, highly transparent (team is keen on keeping this secure).
