Wikipedia defines [_antojitos_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_street_food) as Mexican street food, snacks, or little cravings. The non-diminutive version of the word, _antojo_, means craving. One of the primary activities during my visit to Mexico was to fix the cravings I had with traveling to _the motherland_ and exploring new seasonal dishes that my family hasn't exposed me to.


When I travel, I often discriminate businesses based on their ability to take credit card payments. On this trip, however, I knew the places that are cash only would likely provide the best "comida casera" (homemade or home-style food).
