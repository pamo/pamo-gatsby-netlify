I hoard vacation in unreasonable ways, especially during this pandemic. What's the point of vacation in a pandemic when you can't really travel or do something alone or indoors that doesn't incite anxiety. Turns out there's a maximum amount of paid time off I can accrue and I've hit that limit several times with only a day's notice.

The plan for Tuesday was to wake up early and ride over the Golden Gate Bridge to make coffee outside in the nearby Kirby Cove with friends. That quickly changed when I made the decision to have all day to ride. Why not shoot for something more adventurous?

### Planning and Inspiration
This adventure was a product of plans less than 24 hours in advance graced by summertime weather in the Bay Area.

Haley was in on my original coffee outside plans and after reaching out to her to let her know I had the day off and open to exploring. She had been saving this SF Gate ride report for the "right time", and had to do zero convincing for me to immediately say _yes I'm down_ to a day's worth of gravel riding outside of the Bay Area.

We scrapped our plans to meet at 7am for coffee outside (mentally I thought we could do both), and agreed to be on the road between 6-6:30am heading towards Sonoma and Mendocino Counties.

As a morning person, that departure time comes easy to me. It's not unusual for me to be awake and preparing my first cup of coffee before 6am. Haley, on the other hand, has to have her mind set before making it happen. Regardless of our morning habits, we were both giddy with excitement to be heading towards adventure at that hour.

Leaving early meant we would skip morning _highway_ traffic and arrive at the start in Nice, CA, just after 9am. I note highway traffic because city traffic on Upper Market St was remarkably high for a Tuesday morning before 7am. Our travel time also included a stop at [Flying Goat Coffee](https://flyinggoatcoffee.com/419-center-street/) in Healdsburg for a second round of coffee and pre-ride snack.

As we got closer to our chosen start, Haley remarked that Clear Lake and the route we would do that day must be a shoulder season hidden gem. The grade and length of the climb would be miserable in muddy conditions during rainy winter months and too hot in the summer due to lack of coverage from the sun.


### self sufficiency
cell service
water
 places to refill water, cool places to stop and eat
 layers -- for us it was summer weight
 snacks: had some homemade granola (a first time experiment that has a lot of room for improvement), juicy dates, dried mango, poptarts, a chocolate muffin, and figbars. just the right amount of calories to pull through

### terrain
there was a lot of shifting on this ride. the shifts of our gearing to accomodate our level of fatigue to the grade of our climbs were in the subconcious compared to the shift in the landscapes we got to see on both sides of Bartlett Springs Road.

any sketchy sections?

Tire size recommendations? At the time I was running 650b wheels and [48mm tires](https://panaracer.com/en/products/gravel_en/gravelking_en/gravelking-sk-3/) with what felt like just enough tread. There were no technical features like chunky rocks, ruts, roots, puddles, or mud to have to navigate around at the time and this makes me think the route could be doable on a bike with skinnier tires. That being said, Haley was riding 2.1" (verify this) tires with a much chunkier tread. So, pick whatever you have fun riding on!

tailwind on the way back. eerie how quiet it gets when you're going the same speed as the wind! but so so nice.

### reflection
what you would do differently if you went back, most memorable parts of the ride

What was unexpected/what you planned and had to change, awesome things you saw, worthwhile detours, people you met

We saw a lot of other fire roads/double track that were at least 20% grades. We also saw what looked like a gondola on one side of a creek that looked like its purpose was to pull yourself across the creek. We saw a car that was completely demolished by all types of ammo and perhaps wildfires. We saw snow in a shady spot at the end of the climb on the way back that we didn't see on the way down and some patches of white on nearby peaks when we were in the valley.

This is what golden gravel is made of! Long stretches of gradual fire roads and dreamy views.
motivation: remoteness, nature immersion, lack of car traffic, and a distance comparable to a weekend road ride.

Bring a water filter in the late winter/spring.
Eat at Romi's BBQ. Mask compliance. took in the lakeside view at Romi's after packing up our bikes and cleaning up.
Gas station nearby.
Dip in the lake after the ride.
Pack more water and snacks than you think you need.

I learned about braking bumps on this ride. You'll see them right before the turns in the countless switchbacks along the road. They are there because they're created by other vehicles braking in the same place. My unfamiliarity with them and the steepness of the descents made it hard for me to understand how to approach each set as we flew down. They certainly beat me up and made it hard for me to control my bike on the tail-ends of our descents. I wear an Apple Watch with a metal band and magnetic clasp that had to go in my jersey pocket after the first half of our first descent lest the band rub my wrist raw before unclasping and flying off into the valley below. I'll be looking out for guides like this one on [The Pro's Closet](https://www.theproscloset.com/blogs/news/three-tips-to-brake-better-on-your-mountain-bike#:~:text=Braking%20bumps%20are%20caused%20by,your%20bike%20hard%20to%20control.&text=Option%202%3A%20Brake%20before%20the,speed%20then%20brake%20after%20them.) to be better prepared for next time.

Butterflies in the road. Wanted to believe the same butterfly was tagging along as we tried to piece together the lyrics of Reading Rainbow's theme-song.
Manzanita trees regrowing

Hard to spot on the way to indian springs, but if you do an out-and-back, you'll see the ruins of some old springs.
Torched and barren land gave us apocolyptic vibes. Accompanied by sounds of birds, so many birds, and at some points frogs. The silence otherwise was astounding. Helpful when anticipating a car, dune buggy, or motorcycle approaching in the distance.
On the drive out of Nice into Lakeport, I saw a sign for a Vista Point at the next exit. I remarked that we had visited a lot of vista points that day, and Haley made the claim that our whole ride was an extended vista point. Yes, yes it was!
ornot bar bags filled with snacks, chapstick, and sunscreen. last minute decision to pack s'mores poptarts was a lifesaver. I was surprised with my salivary glands overreacting with how sweet they are, but those things pack a punch in carbs! I was dragging my legs with every pedal stroke as we made our final climb out of the valley. the packaging and nature of the bar-bag, however, made it so that we were fueling ourselves with poptart dust.

where to park/start finish
The route linked in Brian Coyne's SF Gate ride report starts off in Lakeport. If you look at the map, you'd see that would add 10 miles of questionable road miles to the beginning and end of the ride.

Park at Keeling Park.
any services around like food or bathrooms
start landmark: Shannon winery/vineyard
any route watch outs like closures or gnarly terrain or mud or hike a bike (so I know what bike to bring), temps (cuz can vary 40 degrees on some rides!), interesting highlights like historical sites, cool plants, or dumped cars lol.

- the road continues up despite there being another road that continues straight, you want to follow the road tot he left to continue to climb.
- the climb itself is very reasonable. I never felt like I was climbing a wall, but the taxing nature of climbing so long did make me think I could have used another gear (nothing a quick snack break didn't fix).

Also total time to give an idea
